## Development Guidelines

### Constraints

- Do not adjust the imported code such as LIBERO/ and VLABench since I want this code to be clonable and runnable by any user. Make the edits to these directories will effect reprocibility and cause errors.

- **Code Philosophy**:
  - Make edits simple. This code is not production code, but experimental.
  - After each proposed change, give a descriptive explanation of it.
  - Add comments to code
  - The code should be easy for a new user to read and use.
